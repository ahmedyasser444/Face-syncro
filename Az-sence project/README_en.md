# 🧠 Face Attendance System

🎓 This intelligent system uses AI and computer vision techniques to automatically register attendance through facial recognition using Dlib and a graphical interface built with PyQt5.

---

## 📌 Project Idea

The system recognizes the user's face via the camera and checks if it's in the database. After successful recognition, the system enables a button to register attendance manually and saves the data in a well-organized CSV file, containing:

- 🧑‍💼 Name
- 📆 Date
- ⏰ Time

The system also supports user roles (User / Admin), restricting access to attendance records based on permissions.
